# About me

I have expertise in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). I have been working in the fields of quantum computing, spectroscopy, and medical imaging and am a recipient of an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award (Grant #: K25AR060269).

I have developed several NMR and MRI techniques, including adiabatic cross-polarization, excitation and contrast schemes based on optimal control theory, and uniform magnetization transfer (uMT), and applied these techniques to solid-state NMR with static samples, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, and sodium MRI.

I have also demonstrated amplified measurement and detection schemes with quantum entanglements and domino dynamics, and coherent controls over clusters of nuclear spins up to twelve spins-1/2 or qubits. My current research interests include concurrent MT and CEST contrast by the uMT method, sodium MRI with quadrupolar jump-and-return, and solid-state MRI with long-lived responses.
